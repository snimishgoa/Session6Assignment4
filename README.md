This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## Problem Statement

1. In a component create three variables firstName, lastName and title. Assign the firstName and lastName value in ngOnInit().

2. In HTML page create two text box and a button. In text box bind the value from component with the help of two-way binding on the same.

3. On button create a click event and create function to pass the firstName and lastName from the text to function with the help for Local Template Variable. In function get the values and bind it to title with the new names.

4. HTML page should display the title with first name and last name which is in text box component.


## Assumption
Since point 4 asks to display the title with first name and last name i have initialised it in ngOnInit() and it gets updated every time the button is clicked
